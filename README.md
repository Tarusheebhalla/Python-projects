Overview: This project leverages logistic regression to analyze employee attrition, aiming to uncover the key drivers behind employee turnover, forecast potential future departures, and formulate targeted strategies to enhance retention of high-value employees.

Objectives:

Identify and quantify the factors influencing employee attrition.
Develop predictive models to forecast potential employee departures.
Propose actionable strategies to improve employee retention and mitigate turnover risks.
Employee attrition, encompassing both voluntary resignations and involuntary separations, signifies the departure of employees from an organization. Attrition can stem from various factors and carries significant financial implications, including the costs of recruiting, onboarding, and training new staff. Organizations typically measure attrition rates by calculating the ratio of departing employees to the total headcount for a specified period, providing a critical metric for assessing workforce stability and planning.
