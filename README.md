Overview:  This project aims to analyse employee attrition using logistic regression to identify key factors, predict potential attritions, and recommend strategies to retain high performers.

Objectives: 
Identify factors influencing attrition. 
Predict possible attritions. 
Recommend ways to retain high performers.


Employee attrition refers to the loss of employees through several circumstances, such as resignation and retirement. The cause of attrition may be either voluntary or involuntary. Each industry has its own standards for acceptable attrition rates. 
Due to the expenses associated with training new employees, any type of employee attrition is typically seen to have a monetary cost.
Attrition rate at any organization for a given month is calculated as the total number of employees leaving the firm divided by the total headcount for that month.
